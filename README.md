## 1. How Do I Approach Designing Software?
Designing software begins with understanding the problem, defining requirements, and choosing the right tools and architecture. For this project, which involved building a 3D scene using OpenGL, I learned to balance visual goals with technical feasibility.
### •	New Design Skills Developed:
Working on the project strengthened my skills in 3D modeling and spatial reasoning. I gained experience designing modular components that supported both visual fidelity and maintainable code. I also learned how to plan textures, lighting, and object placement with purpose and clarity.
### •	Design Process Followed:
I began with simple shapes and textures. I slowly built on these, adding more complex shapes and ensuring the placement in the scene made sense. Finally, I finished by adding lighting to add realism and depth to the scene.
### •	Future Applications:
This design process, starting simple, validating frequently, and improving based on results, can be applied to any future software project. Whether building user interfaces, game levels, or data dashboards, this approach ensures solutions remain aligned with goals while remaining flexible for changes.

## 2. How Do I Approach Developing Programs?
Developing programs is an exercise in continuous problem-solving, experimentation, and refinement. For this 3D scene, I took a modular and iterative approach, allowing for testing and improvement at each stage.
### •	New Development Strategies Used:
I relied heavily on shader programming, texture mapping, and material handling to simulate realistic visuals. This built-in modularity of the program made it easier to isolate issues and extend functionality.
### •	Role of Iteration:
Iteration was critical. I continually tested lighting, adjusted object positioning, and experimented with various shader parameters to refine the visual output. Frequent iterations helped me spot errors early and optimize rendering techniques.
### •	Evolution of My Approach:
Initially, my coding process was more linear, write, test, and move on. As I progressed, I embraced iterative, layered development. Each milestone helped me build better structure into my codebase and think more critically about performance, readability, and flexibility.

## 3. How Can Computer Science Help Me in Reaching My Goals?
Computer science, especially computational graphics, provides powerful tools for visual storytelling, interactive learning, and simulation. It bridges technical and creative disciplines, making it incredibly valuable for both educational and professional growth.
### •	Future Educational Applications:
Through computational graphics, I developed a deeper understanding of mathematics, linear algebra, and geometry, all foundational in many STEM fields. This knowledge supports advanced coursework in machine learning, computer vision, and virtual environments.
### •	Future Professional Applications:
The skills I gained in rendering, problem decomposition, and graphical optimization are applicable in game development, simulation design, and UX/UI roles. Additionally, the experience allows me to speak on these with some personal experience, regardless of whether I am actively developing.
